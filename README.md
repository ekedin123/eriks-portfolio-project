# eriks-portfolio-project

My own portfolio website displaying current and past projects; also containing contact information

The purpose of this project was to begin development on a personal project portfolio that not only showcases my basic HTML and CSS skills, but to have a site that I can continue to develop and grow based on my own preferences with complete control.

The intention was to have a calm, minimal layout with little to no clutter, clearly indicating where and what each section is.
